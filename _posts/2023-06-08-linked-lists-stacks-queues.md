### What did you do last week?
- Learned about linked lists, stacks and queues
- Became familiar with Leetcode (I have an account, but don't seem to have history from last time I was on it, in 2018 or 2019)
- Filmed and uploaded [video of me doing a problem about queues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHZKYtCZTV4)
- Wrote reflection of video (see section below)

### What do you plan to do this week?
- Review trees and binary search trees
- Choose a question and film it
- Write my second reflection of a video

### Are there any impediments in your way?
- I think I discovered and overcame a few this week -- remembering what software I last used to make a screencast, figuring out how to access my personal youtube account on my work/school computer (I don't understand why CU disables our youtube accounts?)

### Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
- I am thinking about being more flexible; for example, trying to film even if I'm not done brushing up on the material.  I found myself using that as an excuse for not filming, and I think if I am in a mood where I'm okay to film, I should just go ahead and do it, no matter where I am in the week.  Otherwise filming may become an obstacle.

### I need to get used to
- Doing things in Python instead of Java which CtCI is in

### Things I'm thinking about
- Considering getting a subscription to Leetcode
- My strategy is to stick with the Leetcode easy questions for now, but with a goal to try the mediums when I feel more confident.
- I think it doesn't matter what topics I do problems in; the important thing is volume/just getting in there and doing *something*.  Every problem will build confidence, so if I am given problems in topics I haven't "practiced," I will still be more confident than I was before
- I figured out Python notation for deleting an element from a list without googling, but I am considering allowing myself to Google.  Some companies allow this, some don't, and some allow you to use incorrect syntax as long as it's clear what you're trying to do.
- Leetcode sets up a structure and has a built-in IDE and test cases (which is super helpful!) but that's not always the case in an interview

### What went well
- I got the (an) answer!
- Writing stuff from the prompt into comments (what kinds of sandwiches) was actually calming, even though it didn't end up being important information
- There were some times where I think I was good at making my thoughts visible

### What could go better next time
- There is definitely a lot of quiet time where I'm not saying anything
- My runtime and memory use is really bad compared with others.  I also forgot to do a time complexity analysis
- I think I should have gone right to writing out each iteration in a comment instead of trying to highlight things with my mouse
- I went back and looked at the directions to find the front of the queue for the students, but didn't do the same for sandwiches.  This caused a problem because they called the list of sandwiches a "stack" but it was implemented using an array just like the students were (it didn't matter at all which sandwiches were added when)

### Some cool takeaways
- I tried a Leetcode question off camera just to get used to the platform again, and get used to doing things in Python (which I don't use that often, but love).  I struggled a bit, but was very surprised when I actually solved the problem and my solution was accepted.  This was a great confidence booster!
- It is really comforting watching Gayle code in videos and seeing how many mistakes she makes in typing, but she is so confident in verbalizing her approach that it doesn't matter at all
- This week brought back memories of implementing stacks and queues with linked lists and with arrays in my community college Data Structures & Algorithms class (before I attended CU).  It's good to know that information is inside my head somewhere!
- Overall I'm already really happy with my choice of project for this class.  The last time I tried Leetcode, even the easy problems were super-hard.  It's been a few years now, during which I've become a full-time software engineer, and so far the easy problems do present a bit of a challenge, but are totally do-able.  It's great to see how far I've come, and were it not for this project, I would have probably just gone on assuming Leetcode was really difficult and I am going to be terrible at coding interviews.
