### What did you do last week?
- Finished learning about heaps
- Filmed and uploaded [video of me attempting 2 heap problems](https://youtu.be/G6lfYMuHUOY)
- Wrote reflection of video <!--more-->([below](#reflection-on-this-weeks-video))
- Added page that lists all reflections with links (due to getting a comment that the reflections could not be found)

### What do you plan to do this week?
- Review hash tables
- Choose a question and film it
- Write reflection of the video

### Are there any impediments in your way?
- Time management remains the major impediment

### Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
- I think the process is good at this point

### I need to get used to
- Being perky

### Things I'm thinking about
- In a lot of interviews it's okay to write fake or pseudocode, as long as it's clear what the method is supposed to do -- I am spending a lot of time looking up documentation, and I wonder if I should focus more on pseudocode type stuff and less on getting test cases to pass in the leetcode UI.  Not sure.

### What went well
- I remembered to do time complexity analysis
- I think I'm getting better at making thinking visible
- I finished the first problem quickly enough to be able to do a second
- I almost got the answer on a medium level question
- I think I'm doing really well at walking through examples

### What could go better next time
- I'm still not sounding very perky
- I spent too much time reading documentation
- I spent about 15 minutes trying to get my solution to not time out 
- Now that I have looked at solutions, I learned the following:
  - I was confused about k; it can be almost the length of the array squared.  Because you can make a lot of fractions from 1000 numbers
  - I could have used a nested array or tuple to add both the fraction to the heap and keep track of the numerator and denominator
