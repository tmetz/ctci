## Project - Master Cracking the Coding Interview

This project is for my CSPB 3112 - Professional Development in Computer Science class

**Vision statement:** 

My most pressing professional development need is to become more confident with technical interviews.  

**Motivation:** 

At some point I will be interviewing for my next SWE job (if layoffs don't decide the timeline for me).  I'd like to be prepared to tackle coding interviews by practicing as much as possible.

**Learning objectives:**

I will learn the key concepts from _Cracking The Coding Interview_ by Gayle Laakmann McDowell.  Each week I will watch her videos from either the [Data structures playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLI1t_8YX-Apv-UiRlnZwqqrRT8D1RhriX) or the [Algorithms playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLI1t_8YX-ApvMthLj56t1Rf-Buio5Y8KL) on a topic, and read up on that section of the book.  

I will then find a Leetcode problem to solve that falls under that category.  I will film myself solving the problem as if it was a coding interview, with focus on

- Making my thinking visible (talking through my process aloud)
- Finding an optimal solution if possible, but at least a brute force solution
- Talking about time and space complexity of the solution

For my status updates, I will include an analysis of what worked well, what could have gone better, and any other thoughts.

A tentative schedule (updated June 21st) is:

- **Week 1:** Submit proposal and set up basic structure of webpage
- **Week 2:** Linked lists, Stacks and queues
- **Week 3:** Trees, Binary search trees
- **Week 4:** Tries
- **Week 5:** Tries
- **Week 6:** Heaps
- **Week 7:** Heaps
- **Week 8:** Hash tables
- **Week 9:** Hash tables
- **Week 10:** Recursion, Binary search
- **Week 11:** sorts (Quicksort, Mergesort, Bubble sort)
- **Week 12:** Finalize project

**Things I will do if possible:**
- Several other people have mentioned a similar project; I would love to set up interviews where one of us interviews the other if possible.


**Risks:**
- Problems filming (technology, nerves, other things)
- Not understanding concepts
- Not being able to find an appropriate leetcode problem


**Mitigation strategy:**
- Forewarned is forearmed, e.g. the point of filming myself is to simulate the nerves I will have in a real interview, so it's okay if things don't go well -- I'd rather that happen now than in a real interview
- If I don't understand something, I will draw in other resources to help myself
- If I can't find a leetcode problem matching the theme, I will just make a judgement call and choose one that makes sense for me to practice


**Project assessments:**
- The videos I make of myself solving the problems, and the writeups of what worked and what didn't work.
